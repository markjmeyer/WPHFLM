# WPHFLM
Code to implement Bayesian Wavelet-packet Historical Functional Linear Models as described in Meyer, Malloy, and Coull (2020).

sample_script.m contains a sample script with a single simulated setting for illustration.

The Simulations folder contains scripts to run simulations from the manuscript. The comparison simulations, comp_ref_mr_, call R from MATLAB using flat-file communication. This requires the file refFDB.R to be located in the MATLAB directory.
